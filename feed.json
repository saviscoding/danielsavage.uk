It’s also very quiet on the train with most people having left in Jasper. I get the viewing car all to myself for a few hours in the morning and with the empty landscape  that sense of being on my own grew. And throughout this incredible journey the one thing I keep thinking is just how empty this vast country is. There is basically nobody here. A country this size has half the population of the UK. There is so much room for activities.</p>\n<p>But dispite how vast the landscape is, this is the most affected by man that I see. Fields used for agriculture leaves no trees, the fields are patterned by how the crops have been harvested, there are huge farm machinery and buildings that appear almost as monoliths, great churches of the grain.</p>\n<p>The next day some gentle hills appeared and the trees came back. Huge rivers and valleys signal we are in Manitoba. I picked September to travel mainly because it was cheaper after the school holidays but the timing meant that the autumn leaves are appearing and the colours are just stunning. There are the evergreens contrasted with bright yellow and burnt orange and bright reds, and on such a huge scale that it’s almost impossible to avert your eyes for fear of missing another pop of colour.</p>\n<p>Canada has so much to offer, and I have another two days travelling through Ontario before arriving back into the urban cityscape of Toronto, this journey has been a triumph so far and I can’t wait to see what is along the tracks</p>\n",

Now, in the UK you might think you know what a flat landscape is. But now. This is Flat. This is flatter than Flat Eric, and flat pack furniture. The horizon stretches out way way out and the vast horizon line totally circles you. \n\nIt’s not just the land that goes on and on, with the horizon so far out the sky becomes massive as well, and something I wasn’t expecting was the sky felt lower. Like the heavens are able to sink closer to us, whilst still being out of reach. \n\nThis is farm country. Crops have just been harvested and bales of hay scatter the fields. It’s also very quiet on the train with most people having left in Jasper. I get the viewing car all to myself for a few hours in the morning and with the empty landscape  that sense of being on my own grew. And throughout this incredible journey the one thing I keep thinking is just how empty this vast country is. There is basically nobody here. A country this size has half the population of the UK. There is so much room for activities.\n\nBut dispite how vast the landscape is, this is the most affected by man that I see. Fields used for agriculture leaves no trees, the fields are patterned by how the crops have been harvested, there are huge farm machinery and buildings that appear almost as monoliths, great churches of the grain.\n\nThe next day some gentle hills appeared and the trees came back. Huge rivers and valleys signal we are in Manitoba. I picked September to travel mainly because it was cheaper after the school holidays but the timing meant that the autumn leaves are appearing and the colours are just stunning. There are the evergreens contrasted with bright yellow and burnt orange and bright reds, and on such a huge scale that it’s almost impossible to avert your eyes for fear of missing another pop of colour.\n\nCanada has so much to offer, and I have another two days travelling through Ontario before arriving back into the urban cityscape of Toronto, this journey has been a triumph so far and I can’t wait to see what is along the tracks\n",

				"content_text": "A run down of everything I've consumed this month.\n\nNovember has been **busy**. I've overdone it and December is supposed to be the month of excess. It has, however, also been **fun**. And that's important too.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n---\n\n## Music\n\n- [Kendrick Lamar - GNX](https://danielsavage.uk/2024/11/27/now-playing-kendrick.html)\n- [Chemical Brothers - Planet Dust](https://danielsavage.uk/2024/11/28/now-playing.html)\n- [Yannis & the Yaw - Lagos Paris London EP](https://danielsavage.uk/2024/11/29/now-playing-yannis.html)\n\n---\n\n## Gigs\n\n_07/11/24_ **Warmduscher** @ The Ritz - a surprisingly \"6Music Dad\" heavy crowd but the band performed well, even if I wasn't too sure about the newer stuff. ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_09/11/24_ **Homobloc** @ The Warehouse Project - a joyous queer celebration where I finally got to meet Janet Planet from Confidence Man aka the only woman I truly love. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_13/11/24_ **Fat Dog** @ Band on the Wall - a raucous, pounding, energy unleashed from one of the most exiting new live bands around. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_22/11/24_ **The Glang Show** @ Fairfield Social Club - a terrific anarchic proto-gameshow comedy night. Superb. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_30/11/24_ **Confidence Man** @ Manchester Academy - the 9th (NINTH) time I've seen the party-pop Australian band and while good (and Janet Planet remaining my number 1 crush), it wasn't my favourite. ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n---\n\n## TV\n\n**Alma's Not Normal S2** (iPlayer) - fantastic, funny, moving second series. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**The Penguin** (Sky) - surpassed all expectations, if the rest of the new DC universe is going to be like this then bring it on. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Nautilaus** (Amazon Prime) - got bored by the last few episodes, but had some good moments. ⭐️⭐️\n\n**Taskmaster S18** (Channel 4) - it's the best show on telly, isn't it? ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing S7** (iPlayer)- slow, easy television, but with heart and wit. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**The Diplomat S1 & S2** (Netflix) - Missed the first season when it came out, but binged both in quick succession. Fantastic television, cliffhangers and performances. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**How To with John Wilson S1-S3** (iPlayer) - I'm not usually a big documentary guy, but these short episodes are so well done, illuminating surprising niches that humans seem to get themselves into. Joyous. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**The Franchise** (Sky) - with Armando Iannucci involved and with an impressive cast of British comedy actors, I was hoping for something slightly... more. ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n---\n\n## Film\n\n**Dumb Money** (Prime) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**The Rover** (Prime) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n**Deadpool & Wolverine** (Disney+) ⭐️⭐️\n\n**Ratatouille** (Disney+) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n",
