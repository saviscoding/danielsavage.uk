<p>I&rsquo;m stressing at work trying to cram everything in before the big trip. And Villagers can whisk me away into an indie-folk ethereal world while I deal with data. A stunning, lyrical album full of emotion and pictures.</p>

			 <p>To paraphrase the song Hurt (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI&amp;list=RD8AHCfZTRGiI&amp;start_radio=1">the Johnny Cash version</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have I become <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
My sweetest friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Everyone I know runs 5km <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
In the end</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my goals this year was to run a 5km, something I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve done since I was a teenager. This morning I did my third! I can&rsquo;t believe doing a parkrun at the time I used to get in from a Friday night session is who I&rsquo;ve become. But park runs are&hellip; good? A few hundred people having a collective jog in the morning sun is&hellip; nice? Communal exercise, on public land, feels&hellip; right?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not fast, as you can see below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>24/05</strong>: 34:27</li>
<li><strong>26/07</strong>: 32:29 PB</li>
<li><strong>09/08</strong>: 33:00</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Average</strong>: 33:19</p>
<p>But since I&rsquo;ve already achieved my goal of running just one 5k, I can set the next goal of finishing one under 30mins.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s around 3 minutes to shave off, and 5 months of the year remaining. Definitely acheivable and being more consistent will be the key. I&rsquo;m quietly confident.</p>
<p>Yesterday I also hit my 200th day <a href="https://danielsavage.uk/2025/01/01/a-sober/">without alcohol this year</a>. Not in a row, but 200/220 is way (way) better than last year and I definitely feel the difference both physically and mentally. My relationship with alcohol has bent back into my control and I get to have a clear head and enjoyable days.</p>
<p>Really angry that no booze, a run and a smoothie is good for me. Furious.</p>

<p>The present life of man upon earth, O King, seems to me in comparison with that time which is unknown to us like the swift flight of a sparrow through the mead-hall where you sit at supper in winter, with your Ealdormen and thanes, while the fire blazes in the midst and the hall is warmed, but the wintry storms of rain or snow are raging abroad. The sparrow, flying in at one door and immediately out at another, whilst he is within, is safe from the wintry tempest, but after a short space of fair weather, he immediately vanishes out of your sight, passing from winter to winter again. So this life of man appears for a little while, but of what is to follow or what went before we know nothing at all.</p>

			 <p>Email is a peculiar thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a millennial like me,  you remember the hotmail email we got in our teens (sk8rboi13 or the equivalent). From hotmail, I had an AOL account. From AOL I, like almost everyone on earth, got a Gmail account. And that&rsquo;s been it for the last decade or so.</p>
<p>And for that decade, Gmail did the job. It handled everything. From newsletters, government logins, gig tickets, junk, and friends, it all went to one address. But like most “free” things on the internet, it came at the cost of becoming bloated, getting worse, and being part of a global mega-corp. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot more about my online life/presence and decided I needed to reclaim control and make it more manageable and importantly, personal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my own website for a while and it seemed a no-brainer to have a custom email linked that can last me, hopefully, the rest of my life.</p>
<p>After looking at a couple of options like <strong><a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.hey.com">Hey</a></strong> mail, I decided on going through <strong>Migadu</strong>, with <strong>Thunderbird</strong> as my desktop client.</p>
<p>It turned out to be one of the most satisfying digital housekeeping projects I’ve ever done.</p>
<h2 id="the-provider-migadu"><strong>The Provider: Migadu</strong></h2>
<p>I definitely didn’t want to run a mail server from scratch (life’s too short), so I looked at a few privacy-friendly providers. <strong>Proton Mail</strong> was a strong contender, but ultimately I went for fellow Swiss company <strong><a href="https://www.migadu.com">Migadu</a></strong> after reading through their site.</p>
<p>One part jumped out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you register a domain, you own the whole name-space of that domain:</p>
<ul>
<li>All possible sub-domains of your domain are yours.</li>
<li>All possible URLs on the domain are yours.</li>
<li>All possible email addresses on the domain are yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>On your domain, you are also free to choose the linked services such as web, email calendar etc</p>
<p><strong>This is the freedom granted to you with your domain name and the Internet was built to give you one.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The internet was built to give me freedom. I&rsquo;m not sure that is what the internet is for <em>now</em>, but that ideal resonated with me.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m quite tech-savvy, and following the set up for me was incredibly simple. Could my mum have done it? No. But my Mum also has me to do it for her. Not that she will, she&rsquo;s happy with Facebook and Gmail.</p>
<h2 id="the-client-thunderbird"><strong>The Client: Thunderbird</strong></h2>
<p>On desktop, I’m now using <strong><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a></strong>. It’s open source, and can be customised with local folders and filters. It’s not as slick as Apple Mail (and there&rsquo;s currently no iOS app) but, as we&rsquo;ve learned, I&rsquo;m trying to regain control from trillion dollar corporations.</p>
<h2 id="designing-my-mailbox-structure"><strong>Designing My Mailbox Structure</strong></h2>
<p>This was the fun bit. Once I had the domain and host sorted, I had to decide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What addresses do I actually need?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first I thought I’d just go with one but with Migadu giving me the opportunity to have as many as I wanted I had to really think it through.  As I started mapping out how I use email, I realised there were natural “layers” of access and purpose. Here’s what I settled on:</p>
<h3 id="hello"><strong>hello@</strong></h3>
<p>Public. <a href="/contact">It’s on my website</a>, business cards, and anything outward-facing. The kind of email you’d give a stranger at a gig or someone who found your work online. Please use it. Say hello. Let me know you exist.</p>
<h3 id="heading"><strong>#####@</strong></h3>
<p>Personal (redacted). This is the one I give to friends and family. It&rsquo;s just for people I know, like, and want to hear from. If we’ve moved past the “hello@” stage, this is what you get.</p>
<h3 id="heading-1"><strong>#####@</strong></h3>
<p>Online (redacted). I made one as a catch-all for the online world. Newsletters (although my RSS should be the first place for these), shopping, account signups, updates from apps and platforms. Everything the internet wants to send me goes here.</p>
<h3 id="heading-2"><strong>#####@</strong></h3>
<p>Important (redacted). This mailbox is for things I don’t want to lose access to: government logins, banking, flights, identity-linked services. It’s never shared publicly.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-works"><strong>Why This Works</strong></h2>
<p>Each address has a clear purpose. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t get overwhelmed by noise in my personal inbox</li>
<li>If something ever leaks or gets spammed, I know where it came from</li>
<li>And best of all, I control it. No one can take away my address or force me into a new layout</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have Gmail, I&rsquo;m taking the slow and steady approach to moving over to these new mailboxes. I need to work through accounts, edit logins. But it feel good to be in control.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to be part of the small web. The indie web. The micro blog. I get to have a space, here, to put whatever I want on it. <strong>This what the Internet was built for.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reclaimed part of my digital identity. Moving away from Gmail was one small act of independence.</p>

			 <p>In Sheffield some random homemade stickers were, well, stuck around the town declaring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come to Weston Park bandstand on Friday 25th of July at 2:45pm to see two people attempt to eat a whole pack of dry/salted rice cakes each in under 30 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sean Morley <a href="https://nowthenmagazine.com/articles/the-ricecake-gobblers-have-inadvertently-provided-sheffield-with-its-art-event-of-the-year-weston-park-recession-entertainment">wrote in Now Then Mag</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rice cake eating event is the true face of northern performance art. A radical vision of recession entertainment, it’s literally only advertised to pedestrians, a comment on consumerism and the advertisement culture projecting corporate interests onto every empty space in the city environment. You can project anything you like onto the rice cake eating event. It’s the tabula rasa for a fevered mind. It is both seed and soil. It is rich with nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well Friday 25th of July happened, and while I wasn&rsquo;t in Sheffield to see it, it has now been documented for all. It&rsquo;s wonderfully silly and more people should do silly things without some ulterior motive.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading 2025: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780743431675">Call for the Dead (George Smiley #1)</a> by John le Carré 📚</p>
<p>Just finished Call for the Dead by John le Carré. Really enjoyed it. It’s exactly my sort of thing: pre-internet England, spies and spycraft, the dull administration and obsessive attention to detail, rather than the sexed-up James Bond version (though I enjoy that too).</p>
<p>I wanted to be a spy when I was a kid. Not sure I would now, but there’s a certain romanticism to it in these books. Late nights, pubs, members’ clubs, codes and procedures. Maybe what I really want is the life of a well-connected Oxbridge graduate with quiet access to secrets. I dreamt of being important, having some kind of hidden status, of knowing things others didn&rsquo;t. Probably not an uncommon fantasy. I look forward to making my way through the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m back from Glasto. I&rsquo;ve just about recovered, my mind and body are about 75% but my soul is still flying free. I&rsquo;m back at work and thought I would relive the first act I saw while I try to remember exactly what it is I do. This was on the beautiful tree stage in Woodsies on the Thursday. I was sat in the sun with my friends, and was a perfect way to ease into it.</p>

			 <p>Behold! I have returned from a hike.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was in the Lake District this weekend. My parents were there on holiday for the week, and my brother, sister-in-law, and six-month-old niece were also visiting. Savages assemble.</p>
<p>We’re all keen hikers, and it’s my brother’s mission to complete all the Wainwright peaks. This time, the target was <a href="https://www.walklakes.co.uk/walk_54.html">Silver Howe</a>.</p>
<p>Silver Howe is one of the smaller fells, standing at 395 metres, just above Grasmere and not far from Ambleside. It’s a gentle climb with a few steep bits, but mostly the path winds up and around through bracken and juniper bushes, with cracking views across to Helm Crag and over Grasmere Water.</p>
<p>Mum stayed behind to chill and read a book, while the rest of us (niece strapped to my brother) headed out and up. The day before had been all torrential rain and thunderstorms, but this morning was bright, warm, and hiker-friendly.</p>
<p>It’s not a big or difficult hike. A couple of steeper sections, but mostly the path ambled up and around. We passed sheep, a few other early risers heading down, and some friendly strangers who stopped to admire my niece’s heroic effort, which she ignored, of course, fast asleep.</p>
<p>It was also Father’s Day here in the UK, so doing this with my dad, and my brother who is now also, weirdly, a dad, felt especially nice.</p>
<p>After the walk, we met back up with Mum and did the only acceptable thing: a full, hearty, gravy-soaked, Yorkshire pudding–topped Sunday roast at the Waterhead.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Glastonbury returned in 2022 after a two-year hiatus (for some reason?? I can&rsquo;t remember why?) and Foals on the Other Stage was a great moment for the indie Millennials to dust off their dance moves. A great career-spanning set from one of the 00&rsquo;s best bands.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>The world’s elites are inextricably linked. Their fates are tied. A defeat for one is a defeat for all. If resistance can work somewhere, it can work everywhere. Knowing this, ruling classes across much of the world are committed to crushing and delegitimising the movement for Palestinian liberation. If the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that govern us permit our protest to move them, we might start to realise that organising works. They need us to believe that resistance is futile.</p>
<p>The tech billionaires, the finance bros, the oligarchs, the corrupt bureaucrats – each of their positions rests on our obedience. That’s what capitalism is: a system of entrenched, institutionalised hierarchy, based on the unflinching obedience of each rung to those above. Workers obey bosses. Citizens obey governments. Debtors obey creditors. Colonies obey empires. The strength of the ruling class anywhere rests on the strength of obedience everywhere.</p>

<p>Another old setlist in the run up. This time from Australia&rsquo;s Tame Impala who put on a brilliant performance on the Other Stage (we chose him instead of Stormzy&rsquo;s Pyramid set). From what I can remember, a lot of smoke, a lot of lazers, a lot of dancing. Let it happen.</p>

<p>2 weeks until Glastonbury! I haven&rsquo;t packed! I need tent pegs! Argh!</p>
<p>As we head closer to my favourite place on earth, I&rsquo;ll be listening back to some of my favourite sets from the festival, as well as catching up on the music of artists I&rsquo;m planning to see. First up from my first ever Glasto in 2017 - it&rsquo;s Mr Dave Grohl and his band.</p>

			 <p>I went to the cinema for my birthday to see <em>The Ballad of Wallis Island</em>, and what a treat it was.</p>
<p>I’ve adored Tim Key’s comedy for years. His live shows are works of genius, packed with surrealism and pathos. Whether it’s his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/b03pn5pl">radio shows</a>, his appearances on <em>Taskmaster</em>, or his role as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kgyJyNdI8I">Sidekick Simon in Alan Partridge</a>, Key has always brought a unique blend of wit and absurdity to everything he touches.</p>
<p>This film is no exception.</p>
<p>I deliberately avoided reviews and trailers beforehand, knowing he’d be teaming up again with his old comedy partner Tom Basden (who is also superb here). Basden’s music, which he wrote for the film, is also a perfect fit. Carey Mulligan fills out the third role with effortless Hollywood charm.</p>
<p>I won’t spoil the plot for you. You deserve to go in fresh. But rest assured: the jokes are constant and creative and I laughed all the way through. That said, this isn’t just a comedy, it has a gorgeous, tender heart beating at its core. The emotional moments are beautifully handled and, yes, I cried. I haven&rsquo;t loved a film like this in years.</p>
<p>Go see it.
Go see it.
Go see it.</p>

<p>The indie-web (or however you want to call it) can be a powerful antidote to the billionaire owned assets and propaganda tools. Is it enough?

<p>Every major political party seems to be operating under the belief that Reform UK supporters have five votes each and everyone who doesn’t want to pneumatically press disabled people into an impacted cube is unable to fill out a ballot card. We live in the (disenfranchised back of) the imperial core. Here, bigotry is always on the menu. Every policy dogwhistles pied piperishly at sunburnt pink-faced pint goblins who would sink the Titanic with a nuclear warhead if they heard there was a refugee on board. The culture is scarred with ancient ley lines of intolerance and conservativism.</p>

<p>I am astonished by the UK media/politicians who are seemingly desperate to placate the view of people who essentially have the intelligence and disposition of a someone who was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRc0by2vZ7k">kicked in the head by a horse</a>.</p>

			 <p>After a dry Jan and an accidentally wet <a href="https://danielsavage.uk/2025/02/17/a-sober-feb-update/">Feb</a>, I got back to winning ways in March. 30/31 days without a drink, and that one time an almost unavoidable Stag/Hen party. It&rsquo;s been a good month, and I&rsquo;m feeling the benefits both in my head and in my wallet.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole year I&rsquo;m 88/93 days without alcohol. Looking ahead to April there are one or two occasions where I might be tempted, but I can feel that 3 months in, my relationship with drinking has started to change. I&rsquo;m no longer thinking about weekends and picturing the pub, I&rsquo;m thinking about getting round to the things I put off because I knew I would be hungover.</p>
<p>Again, I realise it&rsquo;s not a totally dry month but I&rsquo;m really pleased with how it&rsquo;s going and with how my life will look at the end of the year. Yes, it&rsquo;s a little <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4SzvsMFaek">Fitter, Happier, More Productive</a> but so far, true.</p>

<p>I love to play. I&rsquo;m a kid at heart. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to the stage, to perform and act silly and make up things. It&rsquo;s <strong>play</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can&rsquo;t be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I worked for myself for years for this very reason, and in my current job I&rsquo;ve fitted in so well precisely because they let me approach it in my own way, they allow me to have ownership (within some boundaries of course) and trust me to get it done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important phase in a project of one&rsquo;s own is at the beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely useless but positively harmful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t worked on my creative projects for some time. I have a number of ideas but there is all sorts of thoughts and fears keeping me from doing. I need to remember to play, to enjoy, to not have to force a hobby to be financially productive (thanks, capitalism).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that careless confidence you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a powerful thing to recapture.</p>

<p>I went back to my old university at the weekend. It was about 9 years since I had last visited and 19 (💀) since I turned up as a Fresher. There was an Old Boys football match, and a few of us from my time there were turning up.</p>
<p>The day was both totally nostalgic and oddly foreign. The uni is split in colleges, and my college bar (good old Trev) was still there, in the same layout. There were 9 college bars when I was running around, but on a Saturday we could only find 2 that were open in the evening.</p>
<p>Campus was really quiet, there was no hustle and bustle of students in fancy dress, wine taped to their hands or hanging out in big groups. But when you think that everything they do has the potential to be filmed and appear on social media (we didn&rsquo;t get a Facebook profile until 2007) maybe it starts to make sense.  It seems like rising fees, the cost of living crisis, and the pandemic have stripped away a recognisable part of student life—the social scene I loved and thrived on. I hope they&rsquo;re still able to have fun.</p>
<p>It was great to reminisce and catch up with my friends, there was a lot of laughter and old stories retold. We&rsquo;re all basically the same people with added experiences and responsibilities, but it was nice to slightly regress. Knowing that we&rsquo;re now double the age of those attending classes is quite an unsettling reminder that time doesn&rsquo;t stop and if anything, it feels like it&rsquo;s speeding up.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading 2025: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781682194331">Poetry for the Many</a> by Jeremy Corbyn 📚</p>
<p>As both a Corbyn and poetry fan, this was an easy Christmas gift to get me. Some of the selections feel a little too on the nose but in the current political and social climate, perhaps that’s necessary. The themes of social justice, community, and the power of the many against the tyranny of the few are more relevant than ever.</p>
<p>The book introduced me to poems I’d never read before, and maybe would never have sought out. And I guess that’s the point. Some of these voices, though not always widely known, have long spoken to the struggles we still face today. The world seems to be getting darker by the hour, but it is reassuring to know that these fights aren’t new—and that history reminds us that light always finds a way through.</p>
<p>My favourite discovery in the book was <em>Say not the Struggle Nought Availeth by Arthur Hugh Clough</em>. It captures the perseverance and hope that define movements for change, reminding us that even when progress feels slow, it is still happening.</p>

			 <p>My theme for 2025 was meant to be all about my health, with a focus on improving it. The best way I saw to achieve this was committing to a <a href="https://danielsavage.uk/2025/01/01/a-sober/">fully alcohol-free (AF) year</a>.</p>
<p>I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I was certain it was necessary for all sorts of reasons. In January, I fully committed and completed Dry Jan—even navigating a close friend’s wedding without caving to the free wine and late-night bar. It turns out <strong>I can do it</strong>. Waking up in the hotel with a clear head, no hangxiety, and ready to drive home was a lightbulb moment. This is how life could be.</p>
<p>But February has been a different story. A work event felt like a well-earned reward for getting through Dry Jan, and just like that, the goal of a completely AF year was over. The last two weekends, I’ve gone out and had a drink. It feels like I’m back at square one. But I’m not giving up.</p>
<p>Technically, I’ve been AF for 45 out of 48 days, which is a huge improvement on last year. That’s something to be proud of, even if it hasn’t been perfect. I’ve realised that for this to truly work—like any new habit—I need to be intentional and have a plan.</p>
<p>The streak has restarted. My goal now is to beat my last streak of 35 days and remind myself how good I felt in January.</p>

<p>I live life with a constant narrator in my head. All my thoughts are in my voice and almost always in the third person. The narrator hasn&rsquo;t always been the kindest, in fact it has sometimes been quite nasty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot&rdquo;, &ldquo;What a twat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quote from someone that says (I&rsquo;ll paraphrase) if someone else spoke to me the way I spoke to me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have them in my life. And that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>When I was diagnosed with depression at the end of 2019 (what a great time to get sad) I turned to affirmations to start the day, to try and turn the narrator around, to change who they were, and to reform who I thought I was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ashford, Kent, is known for several key features and attractions:</p>
<p>Transport Hub
High-Speed Rail: Ashford International Station offers Eurostar services (historically) and high-speed trains to London St Pancras in under 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Road Links: It is a major transport hub with the M20 motorway, providing direct access to London and the Channel Tunnel.</p>

<hr>
<p>I bought my first album in 2001. I was 13 years old.</p>
<p>I’d heard a particular song on the radio, and it did something to my brain. I was hooked. I needed to know more.</p>
<p>For those interested, the song was <a href="https://youtu.be/1V_xRb0x9aw?feature=shared&amp;t=18">Clint Eastwood</a> from the debut album by Gorillaz—the virtual band created by Blur frontman Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. Back then, I had to get it on CD from Woolworths. (I only added it to my <a href="https://danielsavage.uk/vinyl/">vinyl collection</a> in 2024.)</p>
<p>I had the internet, so I could dig up a few details about the band, albeit at dial up speeds. They were cartoons? WTF? There was mysticism around them, a sense of the unknown that felt so different from the clean-cut, hyper-accessible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHozn0YXAeE">pop of my childhood</a> (although tbf that is a banger).</p>
<p>NOW OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS THE PAST, AND THEREFORE IT WASN’T EASY LIKE YOU KIDS HAVE IT. THE PAST WAS HARD, MATE. IF I WANTED AN ALBUM, I HAD TO PHYSICALLY GO TO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolworths_(United_Kingdom)">WOOLWORTHS</a> AND BUY IT ON CD. THAT INVOLVED A BUS. IT INVOLVED EFFORT. IT INVOLVED FRICTION.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.diggitmagazine.com/articles/gorillaz-how-global-transmedial-project-can-shake-our-faith-reality?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Even the Gorillaz website was full of intrigue and imagination</a>. It was designed as a virtual version of Kong Studios, the fictional home of the band. You could explore rooms, sneak into a recording session, play games, and uncover lore. Every corner had something to discover, if you were willing to put in the time.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>hearing</strong> new music has never been easier, but <strong>discovery</strong> has become harder. Frictionless listening fosters homogenisation. Listeners may start to prioritise what the algorithms surface, dismissing anything outside that narrow scope as unimportant. And what&rsquo;s to stop your &ldquo;Discover&rdquo; playlist being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24294995/spotify-ai-fake-albums-scam-distributors-metadata">filled with AI slop</a> to avoid paying artists. When art, human made, is sidelined in this way, it creates a dangerous state for cultural growth and diversity.</p>
<p>Everything you need to know about an artist is now summed up in a short bio. Their entire back catalogue is instantly available, along with playlists showcasing their inspirations. I no longer need to carefully listen to each track to piece together what influenced their recording process. The urge to scan liner notes for details—like who played guitar, who produced the album, or whose sample was used—has all but disappeared. The joy of uncovering these connections feels redundant in the face of instant access.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be up to tech billionaires to decide what music I will enjoy. What I listen to should come through the sharing of friends, the surprise of a support act at a gig, or the magic of catching the last 30 seconds of a song on the radio. And fine! Check out the music on a streaming platform! But then get it on vinyl, from a <a href="https://www.piccadillyrecords.com">record store</a>, ask for recommendations and then thumb through the racks and surprise yourself.</p>
<p>There is thrill in the friction. Friction leads to discovery. Friction leads to connection. Friction leads to community. Friction leads to life.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve decided to go through 2025 with a theme in mind. In 2024 I focused on doing well at work, keeping the job I recently got, learning quickly, and becoming a valued member of the team. I think I achieved that pretty well. My finances that were lacking in 2023,  have improved and given me a bit of breathing room. I have the opportunity to build on this in 2025. But work isn&rsquo;t my priority this year.</p>
<p>In 2025, I want to prioritise my health. Specifically, the thing I want to address is my alcohol intake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a binge drinker. I enjoy a proper sesh, and I&rsquo;ve been pretty (see: very) good at them over the years. But I&rsquo;m turning 37 this year, and my body, mind and soul are becoming increasing damaged by alcohol and its effects. The anxiety, depression, and strength of hangovers are debilitating. The tiredness and lack of cognitive function takes days to subside.</p>
<p>If I can regain control over drink, and complete 365 days of sobriety (and more), I think it will have unimaginably positive consequences. I will be a better friend, son, brother, colleague and human being.</p>
<p>Edit: i lasted 35 days</p>

<p><em>27-12-24</em> - <strong><strong>The Songs Of Black Sabbath</strong></strong> @ The Golden Lion, Todmorden - An amazingly heavy night of covers, by an incredible band headed by frontman Mike Vennart. Superb music, superb pub. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>A Man on the Inside</strong> S1 (Netflix) - Cosy, witty, warm show about a guy undercover in an old peoples home. Liked it. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Madness</strong> (Netflix) - Strong start that slowly petered out but fun all the same. ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Day of the Jackal</strong> S1 (Sky) - Loved this. Fantastic cast. Action packed. Superb. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Somebody Somewhere</strong> S1-3 (Sky) - A beautiful, tender, funny sitcom that really surprised me. Wonderful the whole way through and played with such exquisite skill and humanity from the cast. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Black Doves</strong> S1 (Netflix) - Another good one. Another action one. But with more swearing and blood and accents than the others. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Dune: Prophecy</strong> (Sky) - Did I like this? I mean I watched it all. And there were some good bits but it all felt quite slow. ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Bad Sisters</strong> S2 (Apple TV+) - Not as good as the first series (which was tremendous) but had its moments. ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Gavin &amp; Stacey</strong> Finale (BBC) - A satisfying ending to a much loved sitcom. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

<p><em>01-12-24</em> <strong><strong>Manchester United</strong></strong> vs Everton @ Old Trafford - United win 4-0, the feel good factor seemed to be back&hellip; not for long though. Still, a great day out.</p>
<p><em>14-12-24</em> <strong><strong>Altrincham FC</strong></strong> vs Sutton United @ The J. Davidson Stadium - Altrincham win 1-0. It was freezing but had a good catch up with some mates.</p>

			 <p>It’s December, so obviously, I’m in reflection mode—looking back on the year, spotting the wins, and acknowledging where there’s room to improve. One area that I failed at this year was reading more.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, I set what felt like an easy goal: one book a month. Surely you can read one book a month, mate. You used to <strong>devour</strong> books as a child and young adult. But somewhere along the way, the TV and my phone stole the spotlight.</p>
<p>Admitting the problem is the first step. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m a bit of a dopamine fiend. Accepting that means I can start making real changes.</p>
<h3 id="something-old-something-new">Something Old, Something New</h3>
<p>Rather than setting an arbitrary target, I’ve decided to focus on reading books I already know I’ll enjoy. 2025 is going to be the year I revisit some of my <a href="/books">favourite books</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll alternate between re-reading favourites and diving into something new. This way, I can keep building on my library while still savouring the comfort of the books I adore.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this will work if I don’t tackle the habits that held me back this year. That means setting boundaries for my screen time before bed. A book on my nightstand, not my phone, should be the last thing I reach for.</p>
<p>Nice to have a plan, anyway.</p>

<p><em>30/11/24</em> <strong>Confidence Man</strong> @ Manchester Academy - the 9th (NINTH) time I&rsquo;ve seen the party-pop Australian band and while good (and Janet Planet remaining my number 1 crush), it wasn&rsquo;t my favourite. ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tv">TV</h2>
<p><strong>Alma&rsquo;s Not Normal S2</strong> (iPlayer) - fantastic, funny, moving second series. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Penguin</strong> (Sky) - surpassed all expectations, if the rest of the new DC universe is going to be like this then bring it on. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Nautilaus</strong> (Amazon Prime) - got bored by the last few episodes, but had some good moments. ⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Taskmaster S18</strong> (Channel 4) - it&rsquo;s the best show on telly, isn&rsquo;t it? ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing S7</strong> (iPlayer)- slow, easy television, but with heart and wit. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Diplomat S1 &amp; S2</strong> (Netflix) - Missed the first season when it came out, but binged both in quick succession. Fantastic television, cliffhangers and performances. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>How To with John Wilson S1-S3</strong> (iPlayer) - I&rsquo;m not usually a big documentary guy, but these short episodes are so well done, illuminating surprising niches that humans seem to get themselves into. Joyous. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Franchise</strong> (Sky) - with Armando Iannucci involved and with an impressive cast of British comedy actors, I was hoping for something slightly&hellip; more. ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

<h2 id="film">Film</h2>
<p><strong>Dumb Money</strong> (Prime) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>The Rover</strong> (Prime) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</strong> (Disney+) ⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><strong>Ratatouille</strong> (Disney+) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>

<p>What a great day to have a ticket. We definitely need a new stadium but there&rsquo;s still something special about Old Trafford in the sun. Diallo was superb.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about giving up the booze for a while. Wasting days hungover just isn&rsquo;t the one anymore.</p>
<p>I thought January 1st would be a good marker but that&rsquo;s just an excuse to push it down the road, rather than to make the improvement immediately. Especially with Dec being a month of excess.</p>

			 <p>Hello, this post means danielsavage.uk is back online! Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be blogging again like I&rsquo;m on geocities (yes, I&rsquo;ve been writing on the web before Tumblr).</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s being hosted on micro.blog (thanks <a href="http://manton.org">@manton.org</a>), which feels likes everything I ever wanted from the internet.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added some pages for my culture tracking (books, gigs, vinyl collection) and I&rsquo;ll keep adding over this week. And blogging my thoughts more regularly.</p>
<p>But hey! This is exciting. The future of the web is small, independent, and hopefully free of billionaire influence. Looking forward to being a part of it.</p>
<p>(Note to self: don&rsquo;t give up, again)</p>
